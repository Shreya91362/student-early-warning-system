# Early Warning System for Identifying At-Risk Students Using Machine Learning

## Project Overview
This project focuses on designing and deploying a machine learning-based Early Warning System that categorizes students into Low, Medium, and High academic risk levels to support proactive institutional intervention.

## Objectives
- Build a production-oriented ML pipeline
- Store academic data in a SQL database
- Train and evaluate traditional ML models
- Develop an interactive dashboard for analytics and predictions
- Enable real-time risk prediction
- Implement periodic model retraining
